I am a graduate student studying Master of Science in Computer Vision at Carnegie Mellon University. I received Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2019. I am interested in developing real-world applications such as autonomous driving using cutting-edge computer vision technology. Currently I am actively searching for an intern position related to computer vision in U.S. My CV can be found [here](https://jayliu0911.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
