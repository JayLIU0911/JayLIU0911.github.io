Research Experiences
======
**WeChat-HKUST Joint Lab on Artificial Intelligence Technology** – Undergraduate Researcher, *Jun – Dec 2017*
* Project: Learning Analytics for a Personalized E-Learning Platform (Supervised by Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung)
  * **Goal**: Apply deep learning to predict students’ grade and visualize the transition of their learning status
  * Developed a sequence-to-sequence regression system with LSTM to predict students’ grade in time series and achieved a mean square error of 0.003 (TensorFlow, MongoDB)
  * Implemented advanced data structures like Trie to improve the efficiency of course data retrieval from database
  * Built a website to visualize students’ learning trajectories (D3) after applying feature extraction and embedding algorithms (t-SNE) on EdX clickstream data

**Tencent Youtu Lab** – Internship, *May – Aug 2018*
* Reproduced Cascade-RCNN (CVPR 2018) based on Detectron.pytorch from Facebook
* Converted Detectron models (e.g. Faster-RCNN with FPN and ResNet-101 backbone) from Pytorch to Caffe
* Tuned hyper-parameters and ran experiments to gain the best result on Mask-RCNN from Detectron.pytorch

**Computational Perception Laboratory at Georgia Tech** – Undergraduate Researcher, *Jan – May 2018*
* Project: Video Dialogue and Captioning (Supervised by Prof. Irfan Essa)
  * **Goal**: Apply deep convNets and RNNs to build a system that can do Video Captioning and Question Answering
  * Preprocessed ActivityNet videos and fine-tuned 3D ResNets, which are pre-trained on Kinetics, on ActivityNet

**HKUST Robomasters Team** – Algorithm Developer (Supervised by Prof. Winnie Leung), *Jan – Aug 2017*
* Developed PID control systems for chassis and console motors to enhance maneuverability of robots
* Simulated visual environment of the contest site for further development of recognition algorithms (SDL 2.0)
* Designed and implemented UART communication protocol between microcontrollers and computers on Linux

Extra-curricular Activities
======
**HKUST Undergraduate Recruitment and Admissions Office** – Student Ambassador, *Jan 2017 – Present*
