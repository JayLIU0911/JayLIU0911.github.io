Research Experiences
======
**Computational Perception Laboratory at Georgia Tech** – Undergraduate Researcher, *Jan – May 2018*
* Project: Video Dialogue and Captioning (Supervised by Prof. Irfan Essa)
  * **Goal**: Apply deep convNets and RNNs to build a system that solves video captioning and question answering task
  * Preprocessed ActivityNet videos
  * Fine-tuned 3D ResNets pre-trained on Kinetics to produce a baseline on ActivityNet, achieving a validation accuracy of 40% on action recognition task

**WeChat-HKUST Joint Lab on Artificial Intelligence Technology** – Undergraduate Researcher, *Jun – Dec 2017*
* Project: Learning Analytics for a Personalized E-Learning Platform (Supervised by Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung)
  * Developed a sequence-to-sequence regression system with LSTM in Tensorflow to predict students’ grades on E-learning platforms based on the high-level representations extracted from massive user clickstream data
  * Designed and implemented Trie data structure to improve the efficiency of course data retrieval from database
  * Built a website to visualize the trajectories of students’ grades with respect to the extracted high-level representations. The visualization results further validated the effectiveness of the LSTM model

**HKUST Robomasters Team** – Algorithm Developer (Supervised by Prof. Winnie Leung), *Jan – Aug 2017*
* Developed a complete PID control system for a robotic vehicle with two consoles using micro-controllers
* Simulated the 2D visual environment of the contest site and co-designed symbol recognition algorithms
* Designed and implemented real-time UART communication protocol between micro-controllers and Linux computers

Work Experiences
======
**Tencent Youtu Lab** – Research Internship (Supervised by Prof. Yu-Wing Tai), *May – Aug 2018*
* Reproduced Cascade-RCNN (CVPR 2018) based on the Detectron.pytorch from Facebook AI Research
* Converted Detectron models (e.g. Faster-RCNN with FPN and ResNet-101 backbone) from Pytorch to Caffe
* Tuned hyper-parameters and ran experiments to achieve the best result on Mask-RCNN from Detectron.pytorch

Projects
======
**Line Dieting Chatbot** – Software Engineer, *Sep – Dec 2017*
* Developed a chatbot that provides personalized meal recommendation based on user’s eating habit, with features including optical character recognition for menu (Java Spring, Heroku, PostgreSQL, Gradle, JUnit, Mockito, UML)
