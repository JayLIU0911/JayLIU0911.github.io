**Ji Liu**\*, Heshan Liu\*, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang. High-Resolution Pose Transfer via Progressive Training and Pose Disentangling. (\*Equal contributions)
* Project demo: *To be uploaded soon*
* Novelty:
  * To disentangle structure and appearance inherent in a given reference image, we propose a new encoder-decoder architecture that successfully enables seamless human pose transfer
  * We propose novel local descriptors to enhance the generation quality and local details
  * We apply progressive training to our autoencoder architecture to achieve outputs of unprecedented high resolution (1024 x 1024)
* Results: We can transfer in high resolution on Human3.6M, DeepFashion and a self-collected YouTube dataset
